# Dowsing

Hello! Dowsing is my first Fabric mod.

Dowsing is the act of searching for things hidden under the surface of the earth, like water or precious metals, 
by holding one or two sticks. The stick(s) supposedly dip or jerk suddenly when you are over something interesting.

# How to Dowse in Minecraft

Hold two dowsing rods of the same type, one in each hand, and walk around. Once you walk over something the dowsing rod
senses for, you'll hear a ding every so often. The ding will get louder and lower-pitched the closer you get.

Different dowsing rods have different areas, different depths, and different things searched for. See the following table:

| Dowsing Rod | Area (X/Z) | Depth | Scans for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stick | 5x5 | 16 | Water |
| Wooden Hoe | 9x9 | 8 | Ores |
| Stone Hoe | 7x7 | 16 | Ores |
| Iron Hoe | 5x5 | 32 | Ores |
| Gold Hoe | 3x3 | 8 | Ores |
| Diamond Hoe | 3x3 | 64 | Ores |
| Bone | 5x5 | 80 | Lava |
| Blaze Rod | 9x9 | 80 | Mob Spawners |

# Other Stuff
You may use this mod in your modpack! However if you do, please tell me, because I would love to know if someone
thinks this mod is cool enough to go in a modpack.

In the future I'd like to add:
* More rods that search for more stuff
* A config file so you can add your own rods

# Wow, I'm so moved by this mod I want to give you money!
